A custom drupal module hoping to provide an alternate content administration page with improved performance over view-based alternatives.

Just enable and the current admin/content menu item will be replaced with a link to admin/nc-content. Disable and it returns.

To do: general refactoring of module .inc file, removal of some extraneous comments.

Measured locally to be over 400 times faster than the Openpublic Content admin view on NCDEQ.
